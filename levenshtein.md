Let me explain how the `get_distance_matrix` function works. This is implementing the Levenshtein distance algorithm, which calculates the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one string into another.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Function Parameters**:
   - `pattern`: The source string (converted to bytes)
   - `target`: The target string (converted to bytes)
   - `cells`: A matrix to store operations and costs

2. **Matrix Structure**:
   - The matrix has dimensions (target.len() + 1) Ã— (pattern.len() + 1)
   - Each cell contains an `Operation` with:
     - `cost`: The minimum cost to transform strings up to this point
     - `operation`: The type of edit (Match, Insert, Delete)

3. **Algorithm Flow**:
   ```rust
   for m in 1..=target.len() {
     for n in 1..=pattern.len() {
   ```
   - Iterates through each character of both strings
   - The matrix is pre-initialized with base cases (visible in the test)
     - First row: deletion costs (0,1,2,3...)
     - First column: insertion costs (0,1,2,3...)

4. **Cost Calculations**:
   For each cell, it calculates three possible operations:
   ```rust
   match_cost = cells[m - 1][n - 1].cost + get_match_cost(&pattern[m - 1], &target[n - 1]);
   delete_cost = cells[m][n - 1].cost + get_delete_cost(&pattern[n - 1]);
   insert_cost = cells[m - 1][n].cost + get_insert_cost(&target[m - 1]);
   ```
   - `match_cost`: Cost of matching/substituting characters (0 if same, 1 if different)
   - `delete_cost`: Cost of deleting a character (always 1)
   - `insert_cost`: Cost of inserting a character (always 1)

5. **Choosing Minimum Operation**:
   ```rust
   let mut min_op = Operation {
     cost: match_cost,
     operation: EditType::Match,
   };

   if delete_cost < min_op.cost {
     min_op.cost = delete_cost;
     min_op.operation = EditType::Delete;
   };

   if insert_cost < min_op.cost {
     min_op.cost = insert_cost;
     min_op.operation = EditType::Insert;
   };
   ```
   - Selects the operation with minimum cost
   - Updates the cell with the chosen operation and its cost

Example from the test:
```rust
let target = "you should";
let pattern = "thou shalt";
```

The matrix will show:
- Each cell shows operation type (M=Match, I=Insert, D=Delete) and cost
- The bottom-right cell contains the final minimum edit distance
- The path of operations from top-left to bottom-right shows the sequence of edits needed

The test output would look something like:
```
 M_00  D_01  D_02  D_03 ...
 I_01  M_01  D_02  D_03 ...
 I_02  M_02  M_02  D_03 ...
 ...
```

This implementation is particularly useful because it:
1. Tracks both the cost AND the type of operation at each step
2. Can be used to reconstruct the actual sequence of edits needed
3. Uses constant costs (1) for insertions and deletions
4. Handles matches (0 cost) and substitutions (1 cost) appropriately

The final distance between strings can be found in the bottom-right cell of the matrix, representing the minimum number of operations needed to transform one string into the other.
